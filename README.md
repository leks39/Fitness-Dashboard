# Fitness-Dashboard
Mini project that involved extracting data from my Garmin device to build a 2023 fitness dashboard.  

The dashboard focused on four metrics: steps, calories, sleep, and running (subdivided into pace and distance). The goal of the project is to view trends in each metric using months and weekdays as filters and to set targets for 2024, especially in areas that need improvement.

Here is to a successful 2024. Donâ€™t forget to keep fit while working towards all those professional goals in the new year. ðŸ˜Š #data #analytics #fitness #newyear
